# Predictive modeling and classification with regression and KNN
This project showcases Linear and Ridge Regrssion for predicting housing prices and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classifying Iris flowers. It covers key concepts like train-test split, feature scaling, redgularization, and model evaluation through visualization.
## Technologies Used
Python, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib
## Features
Linear and Ridge Regression: Predicts house prices from California Housing data. 
K-Nearest Neightbors: Classifies Iris species with decision boundaries and confusion matrix evaluation.
